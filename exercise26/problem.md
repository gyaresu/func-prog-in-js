Exercise 26: Converting from Arrays to Deeper Trees

Let's try creating a deeper tree structure. This time we have 4 seperate arrays each containing lists, videos, boxarts, and bookmarks respectively. Each object has a parent id, indicating its parent. We want to build an array of list objects, each with a name and a videos array. The videos array will contain the video's id, title, bookmark time, and smallest boxart url. In other words we want to build the following structure:

    [
        {
            "name": "New Releases",
            "videos": [
                {
                    "id": 65432445,
                    "title": "The Chamber",
                    "time": 32432,
                    "boxart": "http://cdn-0.nflximg.com/images/2891/    TheChamber130.jpg"
                },
                {
                    "id": 675465,
                    "title": "Fracture",
                    "time": 3534543,
                    "boxart": "http://cdn-0.nflximg.com/images/2891/    Fracture120.jpg"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "Thrillers",
            "videos": [
                {
                    "id": 70111470,
                    "title": "Die Hard",
                    "time": 645243,
                    "boxart": "http://cdn-0.nflximg.com/images/2891/DieHard150    .jpg"
                },
                {
                    "id": 654356453,
                    "title": "Bad Boys",
                    "time": 984934,
                    "boxart": "http://cdn-0.nflximg.com/images/2891/BadBoys140    .jpg"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
